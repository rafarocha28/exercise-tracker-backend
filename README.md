# Exercise Tracker Backend

Exercise Tracker is a mock app for tracking workouts. This is the backend part of it. It's based on Beau Carnes's tutorial for the MERN stack on [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-mern-stack-tutorial/).

## Installation

You can use npm or yarn as your package manager. I prefer yarn, so examples will use its syntax.

```zsh
yarn
yarn global add nodemon
```

## Usage

```zsh
yarn debug
```

If you're on Windows you can use

```cmd
yarn debug-cmd
```

or

```powershell
yarn debug-ps
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Since this is an example application created to learn the MERN stack, any tips and advices to make it better are useful.
